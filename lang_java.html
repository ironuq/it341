                <p>Java is one of the most popular languages in programming.
                    This page summarizes the features of Java. Please use it as a reference for comparison with other
                    languages.</p>
                <h4 style="clear: both; margin-top: 20px;">Java is actually a beginner-friendly language</h4>
                <p>ava is often thought to be a difficult language, but actually, Java is a beginner-friendly language.
                    This is because Java is a language used by many engineers all over the world, and there is a wealth
                    of books and information on the Internet.
                    There are also various Java community sites as well, so it's possible to learn by yourself.
                    It can be said that it is a very well-prepared language for beginners to start learning.</p>
                <h4 style="clear: both; margin-top: 20px;">Large-scale development</h4>
                <p>Java is a general-purpose language that is used for a great many purposes, but many of them are
                    system development for large companies such as banks and securities companies.
                    The systems of such companies are huge, like hundreds to thousands of engineers spending years
                    building them.
                    For such a system, stability such as "behaves as expected", "security", and "system structure that
                    does not break even if created by a large number of people" becomes the most important. Java is a
                    very stable technology among programming languages, and it is superior to other languages in terms
                    of security as well.</p>
                <h4 style="clear: both; margin-top: 20px;">Services and applications using Java for development</h4>
                <p>Java is widely used in situations other than those mentioned earlier.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Evernote</li>
                    <li>Minecraft</li>
                    <li>Facebook</li>

                <img style="float: right;" src="icon-1971128_640.png" height="300" alt="Android"/>
                <p>In addition to these, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Android</span> is currently the most popular
                    usage scene for Java. Android is an OS for smartphones developed by Google, and has the largest
                    share of the OS in the world.</p>
                <p>Java is the programming language for creating apps for Android smartphones. Google provides useful
                    tools and libraries for developing apps. In addition, if you register as a developer on Google's
                    site, you can distribute your own apps and have people all over the world install and use them.
                    There is also a wealth of books and online information about Android, so it's quite possible to
                    create and distribute Android apps on your own.</p>
